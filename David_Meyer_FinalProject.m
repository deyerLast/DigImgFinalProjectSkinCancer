%Can't work on all skin cancer, so work on just one small branch to start
%and then work on the next one...



%Decided to start working on just Melnoma skin cancer because it has a lot
%of different visual ques to show that it needs to be tested by a doctor.
%Marking this, even with a 100%, with this program only shows that it is
%"most likely" not a gaurantee to be malignant(Cancerous).
