# DigImgFinalProjectSkinCancer
Final project in my Digital Image Processing class  where I decided to choose to try to determine if a picture of a skin mark (lesion, mole, etc..) is cancerous or not.  I'm starting with determining if a mark is melanoma skin cancer or not to keep this small and more manageable as I research if this is doable on my own.
